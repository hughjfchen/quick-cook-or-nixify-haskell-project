# This script wraps the ghcide binary provided by Bazel (through the
# `stack_snapshot` defined in `setup_ghcide`) so that users/programs can call
# `ghcide` simply and have it "just work". Since the `direnv` adds
# `$MONOREPO/bin` to the path, running `ghcide` anywhere in the repository will
# call this script, which will build and run ghcide on demand. Note that since
# we are using `bazel run`, the working directory will by default be the Bazel
# repository's execroot. This isn't generally what you want, so we explicitly
# set the working directory using `ghcide`'s `--cwd` option. If this for any
# reason causes problems, you can split this command into two pieces -- building
# using Bazel and then running the resulting binary manually (which won't set
# the working directory to the Bazel execroot):
#
# bazel build @ghcide-exe//ghcide
# bazel-bin/external/ghcide/ghcide-0.2.0/_install/bin/ghcide "$@"
#

set -euo pipefail
bazel run @ghcide-exe//ghcide -- --cwd $MONOREPO "$@"
