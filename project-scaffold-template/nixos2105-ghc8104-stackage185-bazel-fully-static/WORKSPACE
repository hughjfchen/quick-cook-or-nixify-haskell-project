# The Bazel workspace
#
# This file sets up the dependencies required for Bazel builds in this
# repository. It loads:
#
# * A set of "workspace dependencies", which are the versions of the Bazel rules
#   required to build software (e.g. `rules_haskell`, which builds Haskell
#   binaries and libraries; `rules_nixpkgs`, which integrates Bazel with
#   Nixpkgs). These are all pinned so `dependencies.bzl` so that we can ensure
#   consistent build behaviour.
#
# * Using the aforementioned rules, it configures toolchains for each of the
#   languages used in this repository and any other languages or toolchains that
#   they may depend on. For instance, this repository supports Haskell and so
#   `repository/haskell.bzl` sets up a Haskell toolchain. However, the Haskell
#   rules use Nixpkgs to provide reproducible C and POSIX-compatible shell
#   toolchains, so we also have `repository/nixpkgs.bzl` and
#   `repository/posix.bzl` to set those up too. In general, `repository/<X>.bzl`
#   does its best to set up a reproducible build toolchain for <X>.
