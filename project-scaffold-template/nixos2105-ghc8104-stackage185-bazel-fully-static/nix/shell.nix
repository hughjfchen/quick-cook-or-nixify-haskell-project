# This file pulls together the `tooling` Nixpkgs pin and some specific parts of
# the language toolchain pings (e.g. `haskell`) to produce a `nix-shell` that is
# useful for development (e.g. that has `bazel`, `docker`, `psql`, `ghcide`,
# etc.). This can either be used with `nix-shell` explicitly or implicitly
# through `direnv` (for which there is also a configuration file in this
# repository).

  # This is something that makes it into most of my Haskell/Nix repositories,
  # but is not yet super useful here since static binaries/`pkgMusl` (which e.g.
  # our Haskell toolchain depends on) only works on Linux at present. That said,
  # it is likely possible to set up a Darwin Haskell toolchain that is entirely
  # dynamic for those who want a local development experience on macOS/Darwin.
