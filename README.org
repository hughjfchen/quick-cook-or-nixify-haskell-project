This is a tool which can help you generate a haskell project with the haskell.nix as the build framework.

* Features

This tool has following features at this moment:
- install nix if needed
- multiple platforms supported(currently ~linux~ and ~macos~ are supported, ~windows~ with ~WSL~ may work but not tested)
- generate haskell project with the summoner tool
- generate most usable nix files, including:
  - default.nix :: this is the major nix file which is used by all other nix files.
  - shell.nix :: to setup a development environment with nix-shell
  - cross-build.nix :: this nix expression can be used to build cross platform targets, including fully static binary linked with musl library
  - docker.nix :: this file can be used to build a docker image for the project
- create project based on existing project templates with ~rob~
  - currently there is only one existing template ~nixos2105-ghc884-indexstate20210718-haskell.nix~
  - very easy to add new project template with new build infrastructure

* Usage

Following these steps to use this tool:

1. clone the repository.
2. run the following command under the clone directory:
   #+begin_src sh
./cook.sh <the directory where the project will be put> <the name of the project> <generate|template>
 - generate means generate new project with summon
 - template means create project based on existing template
   #+end_src
3. follow the prompt of the screen til everything is done.

* How does it work

** Nix provision

This tool will check if ~nix~ present on the running machine, if not, it will connect to the official ~nix~ web site and install ~nix~ first, it also set the default ~nix~ channel to the latest stable one.

** Generate haskell project

This tool uses the ~summoner~ to do this job, for more information during the project generation, please refer to the [[https://github.com/kowainik/summoner][official site]].

** Generate the build framework based on the ~haskell.nix~ infrastructure

This tool generates the ready to go build framework for the generated project with following facts:

- It pinned the ~haskell.nix~ version to the current date with the ~niv~ tool
- It uses the ~nixpkgs~ source from the ~haskell.nix~ within the ~default.nix~ file and set the ~nixpkgs~ version to the latest stable nix channel
- It sets the ~ghc~ version to the default one from the latest stable nix channel
- It sets the ~index-state~ for the project within the ~default.nix~ to the current date
- It generate a ~shell.nix~ file with following features:
  + With the ~hoogle~ tool enabled
  + With ~cabal~ and ~hlint~ enabled and set their versions to the default one of the latest stable ~nix~ channel
  + You can optionally enable other tools, like ~ghcid~, ~niv~ or ~lorri~, just check the ~shell.nix~ file
- It generate the ~cross-build.nix~ file which will build the fully static binary linked with ~musl~ library by default. If you would like to cross build for other platforms, check the =nix/cross-build/systems.nix= and comment out for which platforms you want
- It also generates a ~docker.nix~ file which can be used to build a docker image
- It also comes with overlay support. If you want to override some packages within the ~hackage~ database, you can add a ~nix~ file for this package under the directory =nix/overlay= and it will be picked up automatically.

* Setup development environment

Besides the ~shell.nix~, this tool also generates some other files to help you quick start the development:
- The tool assumes you will use ~emacs~ with ~haskell-mode~ and ~dante~ combination as the development environment. If you use other tools, you need to figure out how to setup the development environment yourself.
- The tool will generate a ~cabal.project~ file with the ~index-state~ set to the current date.
- The tool will generate a ~cabal.project.local~ to make sure the ~dante~ will use the new style cabal commands.
- The tool will also generate a ~.dir-locals.el~ and set the ~dante~ target to the executable of the project name.

With above files in place, you can just run the =nix-shell= under the project directory to enter a ~nix-shell~ and start ~emacs~ within the ~nix-shell~ and start to code.

* Todos

Following are the incomplete list of the features I want to implement in near future:
- Add github action CI support based on ~haskell.nix~
- Add more project templates
